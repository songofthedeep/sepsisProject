          <p class="text-sm">
            Sepsis has been observed and recorded for thousands of
            years<sup>[7]</sup>, though a deeper understanding of the mechanisms
            involved has only come around in the recent few decades.
            Historically, it has been referred to as "blood poisoning", which
            today is defined as a blood infection and not the septic response
            itself. Blood infections are typically serious on their own, and are
            likely to cause sepsis if not treated promptly; however, they are
            not a requirement for sepsis to occur.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md">Bacteria types</p>
          <p>
            Most bacteria can be classified into one of two categories based on
            the structure of their cell wall and membrane.
            <b>Gram-positive</b> bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan cell wall
            and an inner membrane, while <b>gram-negative</b> bacteria have a
            thin cell wall surrounded by a "sandwich" of the inner and outer
            membrane. This typically makes gram-negative infections more
            difficult to treat, as antibiotics that act on the cell wall (such
            as penicillins) have a hard time reaching the cell wall inside the
            outer membrane. In general, gram-negative blood infections are more
            likely to cause a severe form of inflammatory response than
            gram-positive ones<sup>[8]</sup>. One suggested explanation for this
            is the presence of bacterial <b>endotoxins</b>, which are molecules
            released when the bacterium dies. The immune system tends to cause
            more inflammation when endotoxins are present. Other bacterial
            types, such as <b>mycobacteria</b> - including the pathogen that
            causes tuberculosis and <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>, the most
            common cause of "walking pneumonia" - can cause sepsis, just as all
            infections can, but is much rarer. For this reason, the
            broad-spectrum antibiotics given to a patient with sepsis of unknown
            cause typically cover most gram-positives and gram-negatives, but
            may not work against a mycobacterial infection such as TB.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md">Distributive shock</p>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Sepsis causes a form of distributive shock, which is not always
            apparent from onset since the body has several compensatory
            mechanisms to maintain sufficient blood pressure for some time.
            Patients who are deemed septic but have normal (>90/60 mmHg) blood
            pressure readings will initially receive IV fluids to maintain that
            pressure while antibiotics are started. In cases of sepsis that are
            caught early, this is sometimes the only hemodynamic support needed.
            In pronounced septic <i>shock</i>, there is excessive vasodilation,
            or widening of blood vessels. For this reason, early septic shock
            can be "warm" - that is, the skin on the extremities (arms and legs)
            may feel warmer to the touch than normal. This is because the
            vessels near the skin are also widened, bringing more heat from the
            core of the body to the surface. Along with the widening of vessels,
            there is also a sort of leakiness, where blood volume is leaking out
            of the vessels. It should be no surprise that this is bad, as the
            blood <i>should</i> be in the veins and arteries, not outside of
            them. Later stages of septic shock are cold because there is a lack
            of bloodflow to the extremities. This is another ingenious mechanism
            by which the body tries to save itself by redirecting bloodflow to
            the major organs, but it will result in uncontrolled death of
            tissues in the arms and legs if not addressed. As with all these
            compensatory mechanisms, it can only maintain organ
            <b>perfusion</b>, or sufficient bloodflow to deliver oxygen, for a
            certain time before organ damage and/or death are unavoidable.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md">The immunosuppressive phase</p>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Even if the shock and initial inflammatory response is managed,
            patients still have a risk of dying during the period of profound
            <b>immunosuppression</b><sup>[9]</sup> that may follow. This occurs
            due to a variety of mechanisms suppressing inflammation, increasing
            regulatory immune cells, and killing off immune cells that cause
            inflammation.
