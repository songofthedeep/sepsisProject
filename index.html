            Sepsis is one of the most underrecognized medical emergencies
            affecting nearly 50 million people<sup>[2]</sup> worldwide each
            year.
          </h1>
          <p class="first-text">
            The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive collection
            of <b>sepsis</b> information. Sepsis is an
            <b>immune overreaction</b> to an infection<sup>[1]</sup>. While you
            might have heard of it as being referred to as "blood poisoning",
            those are technically separate things. A septic response is
            <b>triggered by an infection</b>, similar to how a bee sting might
            trigger an allergic response. Like most complex pathophysiologies,
            the severity of sepsis is a spectrum, but most medical professionals
            simplify it down to two or three categories. Unlike a heart attack
            or stroke, it is a purely <b>clinical diagnosis</b>, meaning that no
            single test can rule out (or rule in) the condition. It's diagnosed
            by doctors based on several things, including but not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>
              <b>Vital signs</b>, including temperature, blood pressure, heart
              rate, and respiratory rate
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Lab test results</b>, including CBC, lactic acid, and organ
              function panels
            </li>
            <li>Presence of an <b>infection</b> or suspected infection</li>
            <li>
              <b>Imaging</b> results that rule out other conditions or raise
              suspicion for a major infection
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="first-text">
            Earlier stages of sepsis are characterized by widely nonspecific
            symptoms, which make it difficult to distinguish from a severe
            infection. Sepsis can also progress to shock incredibly quickly -
            within 72 hours of initial onset<sup>[3]</sup> - but often even less
            than that. Hospitals often have effective sepsis protocols
            established, but since most cases begin outside of the hospital,
            it's up to the patient to seek medical attention when they suspect a
            condition needing intervention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Late stages of sepsis are characterized by an abnormally low blood
            pressure and high heart rate, or <b>shock</b>. The pathophysiology
            of shock can be quite complex, but the essence of it is that
            something inhibits the bloodflow to vital organs and tissues. This
            inhibited bloodflow means that organs are not receiving sufficent
            oxygen and other important materials, and this will result in organ
            failure if not treated promptly. There are three primary types of
            shock:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>
              <b>Cardiogenic</b> shock results from improper heart function,
              meaning that the heart isn't pumping blood correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Hypovolemic</b> shock results from insufficient fluid volume
              ("hypo-" meaning "low"), which can result from bleeding or
              dehydration. Common complications of infections such as fever,
              vomiting, and diarrhea can cause dehydration, which can compound
              with the effect of septic shock.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Distributive</b> shock results from an issue with the blood
              vessels themselves; that is, the heart is functioning properly and
              there is sufficient blood volume, but the blood vessels have
              widened so much that the pressure drops to dangerously low levels.
              That is, the distribution of fluid in the body is faulty. Septic,
              anaphylactic (allergic), and neurogenic shock are all
              distributive.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="first-text">
            To explain the dysregulated response, it's important to first
            understand the normal reaction to an infection. Most symptoms of
            infection are caused by the immune system, not the pathogen itself,
            and in moderation, they help the immune system clear the infection
            from the body. Many bodily processes, including the immune system,
            run on <b>feedback loops</b>, processes that stimulate or inhibit
            themselves. Immune cells are initially drawn to the site of
            infection by pathogens or the damage they cause to surrounding
            tissue. Once those cells recognize the infection, they release
            chemical signals to recruit more cells and cause inflammation. This
            regulated response can be seen in day-to-day life, such as the
            swelling and warmth around a small cut. The swelling is caused by
            local <b>vasodilation</b>, or widening of the nearby blood vessels.
            Blood in a widened vessel flows slower - that is, the pressure is
            lower - and that helps white blood cells exit circulation to fight
            the infection. The vessels also become slightly leaky, which floods
            the site of infection with <b>complement</b>, another component of
            the immune system that helps fight infection. If the infection is
            more serious, it causes a systemic response, which manifests as the
            aches and fevers experienced with illnesses like the flu, Covid-19,
            and major-organ infections (i.e. pneumonia). This is also the stage
            at which lab results may begin to reflect the process; most
            commonly, serious bacterial infections present with
            <b>leukocytosis</b>, or an elevated white blood cell count ("leuko-"
            referring to leukocytes, which is another word for white blood
            cells, and "-cytosis" indicating an increase). Inflammatory markers
            such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin may also be
            elevated, though this can depend more on the type of pathogen than
            merely the severity. Everything about the human body is about
            regulation.
          </p>
          <p class="first-text">
            The danger of sepsis is that this response becomes uncontrolled,
            with the regulatory feedback loops no longer keeping the response in
            check. Instead, immune signals telling the body to ramp up the
            response activate more immune cells, which in turn cause a stronger
            response and generate more signals. The previously-mentioned
            vasodilation that was once localized to a single site or organ
            becomes systemic, and the result is a rapid drop in blood pressure
            that leads to shock. In early stages of sepsis, this is not always
            apparent, as the heart will work harder to compensate for the
            lowered pressure, and vitals can even present normally. However,
            since no internal mechanism is regulating the vasodilation, the
            heart will eventually be unable to keep up with the demands of
            maintaining a normal blood pressure. As blood pressure falls, vital
            organs are deprived of oxygen and nutrients and cells begin to die
            off uncontrollably in a process known as <b>necrosis</b>. This
            uncontrolled cell death also stimulates inflammation and the immune
            response. The body will attempt to compensate for this as well, by
            redirecting bloodflow from limbs to the core where vital organs are,
            but again, this is only a temporary mechanism that buys time.
            Eventually, <b>organs will become dysfunctional</b> (which may be
            reflected in organ function panel labs) and rapid intervention is
            needed to save the person's life.
          </p>
          <p class="first-text">
            There have been several systems used to define sepsis-associated
            conditions and their severity. The currently accepted guidelines on
            definition and treatment is known as Sepsis-3<sup>[4]</sup>, but
            some hospitals use the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome
            (SIRS) criteria to identify high-risk patients. Regardless of the
            system used to determine if a patient is septic, the first-line
            treatment typically includes fluids and antibiotics<sup>[5]</sup>.
            <b>Vasopressors</b>, medications that raise blood pressure, will
            also be used in cases that present with shock. They are also used in
            anaphylactic shock (life-threatening allergies), which is what
            EpiPens contain. It should be noted that EpiPens are only a
            temporary solution, and any form of shock requires treatment at a
            hospital. Unfortunately, septic shock is more difficult to manage
            than anaphylactic shock due to the fact that infections are harder
            to clear than an allergen, meaning that episodes potentially last
            much longer.

                No. Infections of the skin (cellulitis), lungs (pneumonia), and
                urinary tract (UTIs) are more likely to become septic than
                others, but any infection has the potential to become septic.
                That's why it's important to seek medical help whenever there is
                a serious infection involved.

                While all septic responses are due to an infection, not all
                bacteria respond to all antibiotics. In a non-life-threatening
                infection, doctors will often order cultures and sensitivity
                tests. It usually takes the lab a few days to grow the culture
                and test which antibiotics work, but there is no such luxury of
                time in sepsis. <b>Empiric</b> or
                <b>broad-spectrum antibiotics</b> are used, which cover most
                bacterial species. If the cause is atypical, such as MRSA (a
                type of bacterium resistant to most antibiotics), then empiric
                coverage won't clear the infection, and the dysregulated immune
                response is continually stimulated by the presence of infection.
                This is why comprehensive patient histories are so important -
                sepsis that occurs postpartum or after a major operation is more
                likely to be caused by germs from the hospital, which are
                resistant to antibiotics.
