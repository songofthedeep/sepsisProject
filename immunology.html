            The immune system is incredibly complex, which is one of the
            greatest challenges of understanding and treating sepsis. This page
            will focus on the normal defenses the body has against infection,
            and what happens when an infection does occur.
          </p>
          <h2 class="first-heading text-lg">In layman's terms</h2>
          <p class="text-sm">
            The first line of defense are not cells - not living ones, at least.
            The <b>skin</b> is often considered to be part of the immune system,
            and it works incredibly well; pathogens cannot enter the body
            through unbroken skin, and skin infections occur primarily due to
            some break in the skin, which can be anything as small as a papercut
            or bug bite. Typically, pathogens enter through natural openings in
            the body, such as the nose and mouth. These exposed portions of the
            body are well-defended with passive mechanisms like stomach acid -
            which most germs cannot survive - and the respiratory tract's
            mucociliary escalator, which moves inhaled debris away from the
            lungs. Coughing and sneezing also helps expel debris from the
            respiratory tract, and in illness, is caused by the body attempting
            to clear the infection, not the infection itself.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Now, let's say that these initial defenses were bypassed somehow,
            and there are now pathogens in some part of the body. Here, the
            <b>innate immune system</b> kicks in, which consists of nonspecific
            frontline cells that <b>phagocytose</b>, or eat, foreign bodies.
            Phagocytic cells, particularly <b>macrophages</b>, reside in tissue
            that they protect and clean, as well as circulate in the blood as
            <b>monocytes</b> until they exit to the site of infection.
            Tissue-associated macrophages do not cause as strong of an
            inflammatory response as other immune cells, which is important to
            note to understand inflammation later. There is also a
            <b>complement system</b>, consisting of proteins, which perform a
            variety of roles from directly attacking pathogens to signaling. If
            the pathogens are cleared by the innate immune system at this point,
            you are unlikely to experience significant symptoms, if any.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm">
            If the innate immune system can't clear the pathogens, then this
            becomes a true infection. Another part of the immune system, the
            <b>adaptive immune system</b>, will be triggered to produce specific
            defenses against the pathogen. To do this, certain cells from the
            innate immune system will sample pieces of the pathogens. These
            pieces are called <b>antigens</b> (or <b>anti</b>body
            <b>gen</b>erators), and <b>dendritic cells</b> will bring them to
            <b>lymph nodes</b>, where adaptive immune cells reside.
            <b>T cells</b> and <b>B cells</b>, which are activated by the immune
            system during an infection, produce specialized proteins called
            <b>antibodies</b> that attack the specific pathogen. During this
            time, typical infection symptoms will become more pronounced (i.e.
            fever, fatigue, location-specific symptoms).
