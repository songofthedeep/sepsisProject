            All cases of sepsis originate from an infection. Not all infections,
            however, will progress to sepsis, and there are many that are more
            likely to do so than others. This page will cover a general overview
            of infectious processes, signs and symptoms, lab tests and imaging
            that may be performed, and other related information.

            Whenever foreign organisms enter the body, they may cause damage
            either intentionally or as a byproduct of their existence in the
            body. Not all microbes cause disease; in fact, many species coexist
            on skin, in the mouth, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract
            and are vital to daily processes like digestion. The community of
            these microbes is referred to as the <b>microbiome</b> and will be
            explained more in-depth on the
            <a href="immunology.html">immunology</a> page. When a microorganism
            causes an infection, however, it is referred to as a
            <b>pathogen</b>. The most common pathogens that cause sepsis are
            <b>bacteria</b>. Other pathogens that may trigger a septic response
            are <b>viruses</b>, <b>fungi</b>, and rarely <b>protozoa</b> and
            <b>parasites</b>.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg">Symptoms</p>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Most symptoms of an infection are caused by the immune system, not
            the pathogen itself, and are highly regulated. Because of this, it
            can be incredibly difficult to distinguish a localized infection
            from one that has gone <b>systemic</b> (such as invading the
            bloodstream and/or spreading to multiple organs). Systemic
            infections are much more likely to cause sepsis, and as such,
            similar terms have often been used interchangeably. A localized
            bacterial infection (e.g. pneumonia) will be named based on the
            location of the infection, while the presence of bacteria in the
            blood is known as <b>bacteremia</b>. Bacteremia can occur whenever
            there is any exposure of bacteria to the bloodstream, ranging
            anywhere from toothbrushing and small scrapes to full-blown
            infections. To distinguish the latter, an infection in the blood is
            usually called <b>septicaemia</b>, also known as blood poisoning,
            but bacteremia/viremia/fungemia may also be used to distinguish the
            type of pathogen. General symptoms of sepsis are
            near-indistinguishable from that of a non-septic infection up until
            the point of septic shock. Previous systems for identification of
            sepsis have used the SIRS criteria, which are met by having any two
            of the four following:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>
              A <b>fever</b>, defined as a body temperature greater than 38 째C
              or 100.4 째F in adults. In some patients, particularly the elderly,
              they may be <b>hypothermic</b>, with the cutoff temperature being
              any value <i>under</i> 36 째C or 96.8 째F.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tachycardia</b>, or a high resting heart rate. In adults, this
              cutoff is at 90 BPM, though other systems may only diagnose
              tachycardia with a RHR of over 100 BPM.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tachypnea</b>, or a high respiration rate. In adults, this is
              any value over 20 breaths per minute, but can refer to anyone
              experiencing sudden <b>shortness of breath</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Leukocytosis</b> or <b>leukopenia</b>, which refers to an
              increased or decreased number of white blood cells (leukocytes) in
              the blood, respectively. White blood cells fight infection, so an
              abnormal number of them generally indicates a serious inflammatory
              response. This is the only SIRS criterion that needs a lab test to
              evaluate.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-md">Pearls and pitfalls of SIRS</p>
          <p>
            SIRS is highly <i>sensitive</i> but not <i>specific</i>, meaning
            that most septic patients will meet SIRS criteria - but many
            patients meeting SIRS criteria have not developed an inflammatory
            response. There's one important distinction to make between SIRS and
            the pre-Sepsis-3 definition of sepsis: SIRS is not necessarily
            caused by an infection (for example, serious trauma like a burn can
            also cause similar responses), while a positive SIRS with evidence
            or suspicion of an infection was defined as sepsis. The major
            problem with SIRS criteria is that during infection, increases of
            body temperature often correlate with an increased heart
            rate<sup>[6]</sup>, leading to a large proportion of false
            positives. Despite the fact that Sepsis-3 revised these definitions,
            many hospitals and clinics still use SIRS criteria as a way to
            screen for potentially septic patients.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md">Non-SIRS, but common, symptoms</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>
              For an infection with a single focus, such as the skin or an
              organ, one of the indicators that it is becoming septic is a
              <b>sudden worsening of symptoms</b> associated with that location
              (i.e. a worsening cough for a lung infection, more pain in the
              region of a skin infection). Regardless of if sepsis is suspected
              or not, sudden worsening of symptoms should always be addressed
              promptly by a medical professional.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other infection-associated symptoms such as
              <b>intense chills, shaking, nausea, and vomiting</b>, particularly
              if the infection is not directly related to the gastrointestinal
              tract (such as the skin, respiratory tract, and urinary tract)
            </li>
            <li>
              Intense anxiety, <b>feelings of impending doom</b>, or feeling
              that this is the sickest you have ever been
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Altered mental status</b>, such as confusion, not being able to
              remember the date, recognize a location, or signs of sudden
              cognitive decline
            </li>
            <li>
              Other neurological symptoms such as <b>hallucinating</b> and
              <b>passing out</b> may occur
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Because all of these symptoms are hugely nonspecific - that is,
            could be due to any condition or combination of factors - diagnosing
            sepsis often needs additional bloodwork done to assess organ
            function and immune activity.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md">Symptoms of septic shock</p>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Once septic shock sets in, symptoms become more easily recognizable,
            which is a very bad thing - it means that the immune response is
            fully out of control and the likelihood of organ damage, limb loss,
            and death is high. Shock presents with a set of fairly
            distinguishable symptoms:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>
              <b>Low blood pressure</b>, or hypotension. In an adult with no
              pre-existing conditions, this is a reading of under 90/60 mmHg.
              For patients with hypertension, shock may initially present with
              "normal" blood pressure ranges which are in reality low for the
              individual, which is why patient histories are so important.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>High heart rate</b>, which may be markedly more elevated than
              an already high rate due to the existing infection or fever. This
              is the heart trying to compensate for the failure of the blood
              vessels, but it will eventually tire and give out.
            </li>
            <li>
              Low blood pressure tends to cause <b>lightheadednesss</b> or
              <b>dizziness</b>, as well as accompanying <b>weakness</b>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-md">Sepsis-3, SOFA, and qSOFA</p>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Sepsis-3 implemented SOFA (Sepsis-associated Sequential Organ
            Failure Assessment) scores and qSOFA scores, which were meant to
            address some of the pitfalls of SIRS assessments. SOFA assesses the
            function of six major systems based on lab tests. The specific
            numbers are not important for non-medical professionals, but the
            general setup is as such:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>
              The <b>respiratory system</b> is evaluated based on the P/F ratio
              and oxygen support (i.e. use of a nasal cannula, BiPAP, CPAP,
              ventilator)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Coagulation</b> is measured based on <b>platelets</b>, a type
              of cell fragment that circulates in the blood and helps in
              clotting. Lower platelet values, or <b>thrombocytopenia</b>, is
              associated with worse outcomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>cardiovascular system</b>, which includes the heart and
              blood vessels, is measured based on blood pressure and amount of
              vasopressor medications needed to maintain a survivable blood
              pressure.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>hepatic system</b>, containing the liver, is measured based
              on bilirubin. Bilirubin is processed by a healthy liver, and will
              build up in the body if the liver is severely damaged. High levels
              of bilirubin may become physically visible as <b>jaundice</b>,
              which is yellowing of the skin and white parts of the eyes.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>central nervous system</b>, comprising of the brain and
              spinal cord, is evaluated using the GCS (Glasgow Coma Score),
              which is another scoring system used to evaluate neurological
              function.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>renal system</b>, which contains the kidneys, is evaluted
              based on creatinine tests. Creatine is normally processed and
              removed by the kidneys, and a buildup of it can indicate serious
              kidney problems.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Because a proper SOFA score requires several blood tests, quick-SOFA
            is sometimes preferred. It evalutes three things - blood pressure,
            mental status, and respiration rate - which can all be obtained at
            the bedside without waiting for lab results to come back.
